> **SaveServe** – *Smart Food Redistribution Platform*  
> Helping reduce food waste by connecting providers with those in need.  

---

## 📌 Overview  
**SaveServe** is a smart food redistribution platform designed to minimize food waste and help communities.  
It connects **food providers** (restaurants, shops, individuals) with **recipients** who need meals, ensuring surplus food is saved and served instead of wasted.  

Beyond just distribution, SaveServe empowers providers to track their contributions, monitor analytics, and engage in sustainable practices.  
By leveraging modern web technologies and Firebase-powered notifications, the platform creates a **seamless experience** for both food donors and recipients.  

Our mission is simple:  
- ♻️ **Reduce food waste** at scale  
- 🤝 **Support communities in need**  
- 🌍 **Promote sustainability and social impact**

## 🎯 Mission & Vision  
- **Mission**: To create a world where no edible food goes to waste while millions go hungry.  
- **Vision**: A global community connected through technology, redistributing surplus food with transparency and efficiency.

## 🔄 How It Works  
1. **Food Providers** (restaurants, shops, households) list surplus food on the platform.  
2. **Recipients** (individuals, NGOs, shelters) browse available food and request it.  
3. **SaveServe Dashboard** helps providers manage their listings, donations, and track analytics.  
4. **Firebase Notifications** ensure both sides stay updated in real-time.  
5. **Data Insights** encourage sustainable food practices through reporting and analytics.
